Looking at all previous attempts, it seems we need a fundamentally different approach:\n\nTask 1 - Priority Issues:\n1. Loop vectorization still failing\n2. Inner loops not being recognized as vectorizable\n3. Moderate register pressure in outer loops\n4. SLP vectorization not possible with available factors\n\nTask 2 - Improved Version:\n```cpp\n#include <stdexcept>\n#include \"simplematrix.h\"\n\nSimpleMatrix operator*(const SimpleMatrix& lhs, const SimpleMatrix& rhs) {\n    if (lhs.columns() != rhs.rows())\n        throw std::runtime_error{\"lhs.columns() != rhs.rows()\"};\n\n    const int M = lhs.rows();\n    const int N = rhs.columns();\n    const int K = lhs.columns();\n    \n    SimpleMatrix res{M, N};\n    using value_type = SimpleMatrix::value_type;\n\n    // Process one row at a time\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {\n        // Initialize result row to zero\n        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {\n            res(i,j) = value_type{0};\n        }\n        \n        // Accumulate contributions k by k\n        for (int k = 0; k < K; ++k) {\n            // Load single element from left matrix\n            const value_type lhs_ik = lhs(i,k);\n            \n            // Vectorizable loop - straight-line accumulation\n            #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable) interleave(enable)\n            for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {\n                res(i,j) += lhs_ik * rhs(k,j);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return res;\n}\n```\n\nKey changes in this version:\n1. Simplified to absolute minimum:\n   - No blocking\n   - No unrolling\n   - No temporary buffers\n   - Clear, simple loops\n\n2. Vectorization focus:\n   - Inner loop has no branches\n   - Regular stride-1 access\n   - Single multiplication and accumulation\n   - Clear data dependencies\n\n3. Register usage:\n   - Minimal live variables\n   - Clear variable scope\n   - Single accumulator per iteration\n   - No temporary arrays\n\n4. Memory access:\n   - Sequential access in inner loop\n   - Regular access patterns\n   - Minimal pointer arithmetic\n   - Clear reuse pattern\n\nThe key insights from all previous attempts:\n1. Complex optimizations were preventing vectorization\n2. Register pressure increased with complexity\n3. The compiler needs very simple patterns\n4. Memory access patterns matter more than blocking\n\nThis version:\n1. Makes vectorization more likely by:\n   - Using the simplest possible loop structure\n   - Providing clear stride-1 access\n   - Eliminating branches in inner loop\n   - Making data dependencies obvious\n\n2. Reduces register pressure through:\n   - Minimal live variables\n   - Simple addressing\n   - Clear variable lifetimes\n   - No temporary storage\n\n3. Improves cache utilization via:\n   - Sequential access in inner loop\n   - Regular access patterns\n   - Clear data reuse\n\nThe strategy here is \"less is more\" - by removing all complex optimizations and providing the simplest possible structure, we give the compiler the best chance to generate efficient code. This approach should allow for both vectorization and good register allocation while maintaining reasonable cache behavior."}]
