The matrix is processed in smaller blocks that fit in the cache.\n\n2. **Loop Unrolling**: Unrolled the innermost loops to process 4x4 blocks at a time, reducing loop overhead and enabling better instruction-level parallelism.\n\n3. **Aggressive Value Caching**: Cached more values from the input matrices to reduce memory access.\n\n4. **Optimized Initialization**: Used unrolled initialization for the result matrix in 4x4 blocks.\n\n5. **Boundary Handling**: Added proper boundary checks for non-multiple-of-4 matrix dimensions.\n\nThe improvements in this version include:\n- Better cache utilization through blocking\n- Reduced loop overhead through unrolling\n- More efficient use of CPU pipelines\n- Reduced memory access through aggressive value caching\n- Maintained correctness for all matrix sizes\n\nNotes:\n1. The BLOCK_SIZE constants should be tuned based on your specific CPU's cache sizes.\n2. This version assumes the matrices are stored in row-major order. If they're in column-major order, the blocking strategy should be adjusted.\n3. The unrolling factor (4) can be adjusted based on the target architecture.\n4. For very small matrices, the overhead of blocking might not be worth it, so you might want to add a size threshold.\n\nThis version should show significant performance improvements for larger matrices, especially when they don't fit entirely in the CPU cache."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1050,"output_tokens":2141}}}

Block sizes can be tuned based on specific CPU characteristics for optimal performance.\n\nNote that the actual performance improvement will depend on:\n- CPU architecture and cache sizes\n- Matrix dimensions\n- Memory subsystem characteristics\n- Compiler optimizations\n\nYou might want to experiment with different block sizes (BLOCK_SIZE, MINI_BLOCK) for your specific use case and hardware."}
