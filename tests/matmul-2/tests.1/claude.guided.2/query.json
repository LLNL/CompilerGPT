Reduced register pressure:\n   - Smaller block size (16 instead of 32)\n   - Register blocking with size 4 to better utilize CPU registers\n   - Explicit temporary variables to help register allocation\n\n2. Better vectorization opportunities:\n   - Aligned access patterns with REGISTER_BLOCK\n   - Separate vectorizable initialization loop\n   - Explicit register blocking in inner loop\n\n3. Memory access optimization:\n   - Maintained the cache-friendly blocking structure\n   - Added register blocking for better locality\n   - Reduced memory traffic with temporary variables\n\n4. Loop structure improvements:\n   - Clear separation between vector operations and cleanup\n   - Maintained loop ordering for cache efficiency\n   - Explicit temporary variables to reduce memory operations\n\nThese changes should address the main issues from the optimization report while maintaining numerical correctness. The register blocking should significantly reduce the register pressure and copy operations, while the aligned access patterns should better enable vectorization."},{"role":"user","content":"The compiler optimization report for the latest version is as follows:\n\nsimplematrix3.cc:33:9: remark: the cost-model indicates that vectorization is not beneficial [-Rpass-missed=loop-vectorize]\n   33 |         for (;
