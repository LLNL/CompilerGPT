Kept the original loop ordering to maintain correctness\n5. Added pre-computation of frequently used values\n6. Hoisted invariant computations where possible\n\nThis version should maintain correctness while still providing optimization benefits through:\n- Reduced loop overhead through collapse\n- Better register usage through value pre-computation\n- Improved locality through merged loops\n- Maintained original parallel execution structure\n\nThe changes are more conservative to ensure correctness while still addressing some of the performance opportunities identified in the compiler report."},{"role":"user","content":"The compiler optimization report for the latest version is as follows:\n\nbt2.c:1813:33: remark: failed to move load with loop-invariant address because the loop may invalidate its value [-Rpass-missed=licm]\n 1813 |                 for (k = 1;

Removed problematic SIMD directives that weren't helping\n2. Added explicit pointer arithmetic to help compiler track memory accesses\n3. Pre-computed loop bounds to eliminate repeated calculations\n4. Improved spatial locality with better array indexing\n5. Reduced register pressure by breaking computations into smaller chunks\n6. Used more const qualifiers to help compiler optimization\n7. Added schedule(static) to improve load balancing\n8. Pre-computed array indices to reduce address calculations\n9. Restructured loops to improve cache usage\n10. Used pointer aliasing to help compiler track memory dependencies\n\nThe changes focus on:\n- Making memory access patterns more predictable\n- Reducing register pressure\n- Improving cache locality\n- Helping compiler with alias analysis\n- Eliminating redundant computations\n- Making loop invariants more obvious to compiler\n\nThese modifications should address most of the optimization report warnings while maintaining numerical correctness."},{"role":"user","content":"The compiler optimization report for the latest version is as follows:\n\nbt4.c:1873:29: remark: failed to move load with loop-invariant address because the loop may invalidate its value [-Rpass-missed=licm]\n 1873 |             for (i = 1;

Improved data locality with slice-based access\n5. Better register reuse through value caching\n6. More explicit loop bounds and stride calculations\n7. Merged related computations to reduce memory operations\n8. Simplified array indexing patterns\n9. Added explicit stride-based array access\n10. Used consistent loop variable scoping\n\nThese changes aim to:\n- Make vectorization more likely by simplifying memory access patterns\n- Reduce register pressure through better value reuse\n- Help compiler with loop invariant code motion\n- Improve cache utilization through better memory access patterns\n\nThe code maintains the same computations while providing better optimization opportunities."},{"role":"user","content":"The compiler optimization report for the latest version is as follows:\n\nbt5.c:1875:10: remark: load of type i64 not eliminated [-Rpass-missed=gvn]\n 1875 |     for (int j = 1;
