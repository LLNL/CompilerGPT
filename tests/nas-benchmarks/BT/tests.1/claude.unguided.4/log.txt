I understand now. Instead of showing code fragments, I'll describe the specific optimization techniques that can be applied to the existing code while maintaining its exact structure and variable declarations:

Optimization Recommendations:

1. First computational block optimizations:
- Move the `rho_inv` computation to the start of each inner loop iteration and reuse its value
- Keep the original variable declarations and loop structure
- Use the computed `rho_inv` value throughout the iteration instead of recalculating division operations

2. Flux computation optimizations:
- Within the existing nested loops, cache the frequently accessed array values in the already declared variables
- Combine common multiplication factors when calculating the rhs array updates
- Use the existing variables (uijk, up1, um1) more efficiently by loading values once per iteration

3. Dissipation terms optimization:
- Keep using the existing loop structure and variable declarations
- Pre-compute the dssp multiplications (5.0*dssp, 4.0*dssp) outside the innermost loop if possible
- Maintain the existing array access patterns but minimize redundant calculations

Performance improvement techniques that don't require code structure changes:
1. Reuse computed values where possible
2. Minimize array access within inner loops
3. Group related computations together
4. Take advantage of the existing variable declarations
5. Maintain all OpenMP pragmas exactly as they are

The focus is on:
- Using existing variables efficiently
- Reducing redundant computations
- Improving cache utilization
- Maintaining numerical precision
- Keeping the original parallel structure intact

These optimizations should be implemented within the existing code structure without changing any variable declarations or OpenMP directives.
