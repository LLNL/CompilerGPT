Optimize for cache line usage\n\nTrade-offs:\n- Giving up on vectorization for now\n- Using smaller chunks for better register allocation\n- Simplifying the code structure\n- Focusing on predictable execution\n\nThis version prioritizes:\n- Minimal register pressure\n- Simple, predictable execution\n- Cache-friendly access patterns\n- Clear data dependencies\n\nThe goal is to get stable, predictable performance even if we sacrifice potential vector operations."}]
