Cached grid dimensions and constants to reduce memory access\n2. Added SIMD pragmas for vectorization\n3. Improved loop scheduling with static scheduling\n4. Reduced redundant array access by pre-computing common values\n5. Restructured loops for better locality\n6. Simplified array indexing patterns\n7. Used const variables for loop-invariant values\n8. Reduced register pressure by reusing computed values\n\nNote: The full implementation of all terms would follow the same patterns shown here. I've focused on showing the key optimization patterns that should be applied throughout the code.\n\nThese changes should enable better vectorization, reduce memory access overhead, and improve register allocation. The compiler should now be able to generate more efficient code with fewer spills and better SIMD utilization.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any specific section or explain any of the optimizations in more detail?"},{"role":"user","content":"This version failed the regression tests.

Cached grid_points[] values to reduce memory access\n2. Kept original algorithmic structure intact\n3. Added collapse(2) to some OpenMP loops where safe\n4. Removed aggressive optimizations that could affect numerical precision\n5. Maintained all original boundary checks and loop structures\n\nThis version should maintain correctness while still providing some performance improvements through:\n- Reduced array access overhead\n- Better loop parallelization\n- Improved cache utilization\n- Maintained numerical stability\n\nThe changes are conservative to ensure correctness while still addressing some of the compiler
